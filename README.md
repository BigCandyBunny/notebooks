# Notebooks
This repository documents researches on
- Systematic trading strategies (mainly using futures at the moment) that are published in the academic space

The purpose is to reproduce what are presented in the papers, update the results on a regular basis and potentially add further experiments. Notebooks are automatically pushed to github.

Currently it maintains following strategies:
- Time-series momentum (Moskowitz 2012)
- Time-series momentum (Baltas 2020)
- FX carry
- Commodity term structure (aka commodity carry, Koijen 2018 etc)
- Commodity momentum (Asness 2013 etc)
- Commodity skewness (Fernandez-Perez 2018 etc)
- Cross-asset skewness (Baltas 2019 etc)

Additionally, there are notebooks on the following topics:
